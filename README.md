Meteorite-mapping-app

This app was built using the following libraries / resources:

React JavaScript Library
React Leaflet JavaScript Library
React Leaflet Markercluster
MUI React Component Library
NASA's Open Data Portal - Meteorite Landings API (https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh)

As there are > 45,000 meteorites recorded the app is too slow when all results are shown, therefore only the first 5,000 are requested via the API.

To get going with this app use 'npm install' to install all dependencies, and then 'npm start' to view the app in your chosen browser.
